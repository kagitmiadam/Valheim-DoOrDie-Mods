## Questing

Uses Aedenthorn's Questing system as a soft requirement. (Includes cfg's and custom quest files, use down to user)
For questing to work you will require these 2 mods from nexus mods. 

- [Questing Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1583)
- [Hugin Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1588)

Install them in to your profiles, BepInEx\Plugins folder, or, your main games BepInEx\Plugins folder if you manually installed all your mods.

Integrated Bone Appetit and Potions Plus items into the DoD Quest's as rewards. These mods will be required. I know they are in the mod list, I also know a few of you play without them, take this as a pre warning.

Hugin will offer a quest every 20 mins. There is a mix of Killing, Gathering, Cooking, Mining, Collecting and Gardening quests, well more like Tasks tbh, 161 in total.


## Known Issues

**Better Raids**

In com.alexanderstrada.rrrbetterraids.cfg, I have the option: UpdateEventMobMinimapPins option set to false. This is to prevent an error showing in the log when you leave the raid event zone with mobs still alive. You can turn this option on as it does not look to effect game play in anyway. Upto User.

**Questing**

Random Quests can be odd. Issue with custom mobs not registering for kill quests. Been looked at.


## Incompatible Mods

- ValhiemLib and by extension any mod that still uses this defunct library.
- JotunnLib and by extension any mod that still uses this defunct library.
- ValheimPlus (Conflicts with some of the dependencies)
- Valhiem Level System (Conflicts with Epic Loot and Dual Wield)
- Serverside Simulations (Breaks Spawners)


## Mods that can cause Issues

- Simply Recycling can break Epic Loot/Tombstone depending on mods used.
- Terrahiem. (Can cause NRE Spam due to clashing)
- Forgotten Biomes. (Can  cause NRE Spam due to clashing)


## Difficulty

Mobs have 40% more health and 35% more damage and an additional 20% health and 17.5% damager per player.
Scaling difficulty for all Monsters, 5% per World Level.
Vanilla bosses get a Buff per world level after killing them the first time. (The buff increases their Tier by 1 per world level)
Monsters gain 25% Health and Damage after you kill the Vanilla boss in that Biome.


## Servers

Required on both server and client due to dependencies.
May require balancing for more than 2-3 players at a time. Can be done by tweaking the DoD CLLC yaml's located in the Configs folder.


## Acknowledgements

	A special thanx to: DefendYourBase, RandyKnapp, Neurod0me, Tykea, HugotheDwarf, GoldenJude and ASharpPen, creators of the mods used.

**Changing CLLC settings**

- Do not change it off Custom or World Level. This will mess thing up and you may find yourself with enemies you can not handle if you did not adjust most of the other settings to balance it out.
- If you require to tweak the settings, you can do the difficulty via the DoD CLLC yamls. World and Sector days will also provide a buffer if increased.
